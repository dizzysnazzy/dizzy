PERSONAL STATEMENT
I am a young developer who enjoys using programming
languages such as Java, php, Python and C to help entrepreneurs
improve their systems from manual to computerized.

PROJECT

2019-11 - Current
System Developer, self-employed, Eldoret, UasinGishu

Most hotels I visited had poor management of
documents encouraged by manual systems, several
cases were reported where guests complained of
overcharging. Some customers would come back to
the hotel requesting for previous issues and it was
so difficult to trace back the customers’ services
because the hotel used manual system. Sometimes
due to poor communication, some customers
complained for being served with services they
didn’t order. I went ahead and developed a Hotel
Management System using Java language. This
enabled easy update of the guest records and
helped reduce the congestion of customers
ensuring best service output for customer
satisfaction purposes. The hotels that have used
this System have improved their businesses by
35%. This is due to high customer service standards
which attract more customers to the hotel.
